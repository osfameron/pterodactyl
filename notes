cursor is zipper.  Knows position by char, and by indexes (e.g. of newlines,
words, etc.)

indexing done by lexer (which can then feed into highlighter)

components:
  - lexer
  - highlighter

movements
  direction (f/b)
  inner/outer position (could be delimiter)

  e.g.
    "foo bar^ baz"
      /ba (forward and back)
         bbBBFff
      movement commands could go to:
        begin B
        end b
        begin b
        end F
        begin f
        end F
      and can act on whole area bBFf

    either:
      "inner" would be "BF" area
      "outer" would be "bBFf" area
    OR
      bBFf is calculated separately
      e.g.   <foo><bar> ^ </foo></bar>
                  BBBBBB F
      (should movement F/B commands be calculated from this?)

    defmulti dispatch?

    It looks like Movement commands should be:
      :: zipper -> zipper

    But this would allow badly behaved movement commands to return malformed
    zippers (e.g. behave destructively)

    Options:
      a) don't worry, just ask them nicely to be well behaved
        (this is fine, but other options are quite interesting)
      b) search with a fold of zipper movements, that returns true
        at the correct zipper.
        (this allows us to peek back/forth as required, but not change
        anything).
        But is it inefficient - e.g. if we can search more efficiently
        by using the index etc.
      c) communicate back to main function with a protocol
        e.g. by returning something like
          :next-piece   # discard this piece, giving me the zipper starting at
                        # next piece
          [5 2]         # inner at position 5, 2-long delimiter
          nil           # couldn't complete movement
        except that we might need to keep state, so would that have to be
        passed back and forth between functions?
      d) perhaps something like above, but the movement function accepts a
         function for next-piece (that updates an atom with the zipper)
         this allows the movement command to simply return the offset from
         current @zipper, maintaining its own state

z  !misc (mostly zoom/folds)   !unused, but see ZZ
  
Notes:
  - should the WORD (inc punctuation) movements be an option?
  - e/E could move beginning/end of current word/selection instead
    (like O in visual mode)
  - t/f should find character anywhere, and n/N repeat that search, freeing
        up ,/;
     - or choose inner/outer as default, for example inner (t),
       and then use {go}{outer}t e.g. gat or gif for the alternative
  - U as "explore undo tree"?      
  - g should become "goto THING"
  - k could become various lookups (help, definition etc.)
  - should i/a/o take text objects?
      e.g. {with}{sentence}O (open newline before current sentence)
      ... or should default way be {text object}{grow/shrink}{operation} instead of other way around?
      ... which I guess is the visual-mode way of thinking about things, is
      that what I want?
      (ish, but I still want dd, D, C, d0, x)
  - macro recording can be a function call or composite keystroke
    (or alternatively q ok, and Q to call it)
