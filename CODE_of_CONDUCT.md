# Code of Conduct

Though project Pterodactyl is named after a dinosaur, the only thing old
fashioned, hidebound and frightening about us should be our love for 1970s style
text editors.

This project is governed by the Contributor Covenant version 1.4
(http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code_of_conduct.md). All
contributors and participants agree to abide by its terms.
